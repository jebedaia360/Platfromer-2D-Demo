Secret Maryo Chronicles
=======================

NOTE
----

SMC is no longer under active development. However, there is now a
new game based on SMC:

https://github.com/secretchronicles/TSC

What is it?
-----------

From the official website at http://www.secretmaryo.org:

> Secret Maryo Chronicles is an Open Source two-dimensional platform
> game with a design similar to classic computer games. SMC has
> computer support to a great degree by using an accelerated [Open
> Graphics Library](http://opengl.org) for the best possible graphic
> design and stock performance.

It features a wealth of levels, powerups, great music and much more â€”
see http://www.secretmaryo.org/index.php?page=about for a more
comprehensive list. And for those still not getting enough, it
provides a great in-game level editor.
